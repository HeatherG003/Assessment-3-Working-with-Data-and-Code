This was my first draft of the Holiday themed game

Version 1 of the game had the Princess sprite exstinguishing the fires, the musical effects, the game over graphic and the countdown feature.

However, comparing this game to other ones I have played, it lacked innovation and willingness to keep playing after one round. 
Though i was really proud I could even create a game from scratch but once I gained more confidence I knew more could be added.
This was before i decided to include an enemy character the Halloween ghost to expand the storyline of this Holiday game
