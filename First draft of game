This was my first draft of the Holiday game

Version 1 of the game had the Princess sprite extinguishing the fires, the musical effects, the game over graphics and the countdown feature.

However, comparing this game to other ones I have played, it lacked innovation and willingness to keep playing after one round. 
Though I was really proud, I could even create a game from scratch, but once I gained more confidence, I knew more could be added.
This was before I decided to include an enemy character, the Halloween ghost, to expand the storyline of this Holiday game.
