This Python code was my lastest version of the website before I decided to change my project idea (From A2 video)
The code on this software Replit would not show the website on its webview function. 
Therefore, it was difficult to edit the website to correct errors and see the website. 
Trying to problem solve and fix the issue occurred for a couple of weeks, and the trial and error of different websites and apps to help launch the website. 
I also asked individuals that I know that code but still the issue did not resolve itself. 
Therefore, the conclusion was made that my computer firewall did not like this function or didn't want to launch it for some reason.
